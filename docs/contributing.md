# Contributing to Digital Pāḷi Dictionary

There are many ways to contribute to the project, but the two main areas that need attention are __Pāḷi__ and __coding__.

## Pāḷi 

If you are skilled in Pāḷi, either through monastic or academic training, please get in touch [by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com) about what task needs to be tackled next.  

The most direct way to help with the Pāḷi is by using the dictionary and reporting any mistakes using the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9boBe7k5tCwq7LdWgBHHGIPVc4ROO5yjVDo1X5LDAxkmGWQ).

Or if you come across any missing words, especially in commentaries and later literature, please [add missing words](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfResxEUiRCyFITWPkzoQ2HhHEvUS5fyg68Rl28hFH6vhHlaA/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=GoldenDict+2024-09-23).

### Code Review
Most of the code has been written by non-professional coders. Please [get in touch](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com) to take one portion of the code, understand it's purpose and provide suggestions for improvement.

### Python development
Python is the main language used throughout the project. If you are a Python developer, please [get in touch](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com) to find out what needs to be done next.

### App development
A dedicated App is a long-term goal of the project, integrating all the current features of DPD into a multi-platform application. If you are am App developer and can help in any way, even just in conceptualizing the project, please [get in touch](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com).
